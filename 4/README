This program makes use of hermite cubics and tons of changeable variables to 
achieve a roller coaster scene that is somewhat flexible (slightly..).

All curves are connected and achieve C1-continuity (since every point used to 
build hermite curve are defined in such a way that the coordinates and tangents 
of two interconnecting curves are equivalent, respectively of course).

The animation can be manipulated by 3 sliders, which do the following:
    Slider1: add or remove stick men on the roller coaster
    Slider2: bend the track in a presumably unusual way
    Slider3: add axes to aid visualization, if one wants to examine quite closely

Sorry the speed of the animation is not adjustable, since my CPU is taking heavy
toll already at this point.

Enjoy :)
