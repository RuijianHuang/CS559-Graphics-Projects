This program is a simple drawing with manipulations of basic properties of a 
manually-drawn pattern (in this case, an abysmal mimicry of a certain typography
of the 1st letter of my first name) and (self-defined) special effects.
The pattern can be controlled by 6 different sliders.

Sliders - From top to bottom:
    slider1: control sizing [smaller <-> larger]
    slider2: control rotation [degree: 0-720] and #corners of the outer rings
    slider3: control linewidth
    slider4~6: control colors main pattern ("R") and its surrounding in a (rather)
            contrasting manner

That's it, thanks!
