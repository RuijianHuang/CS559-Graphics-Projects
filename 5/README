This program is a helicopter view of a "tightrope dancing" scene, which 
does not make lots of sence. But check it out!
Some waltz music might be a good accompaniment.

Some components of this program include basic 3D objects, animation, bezier
curve (adjustable), perspective projection (one roof slightly smaller than 
another), and stick figures!
The only slider acts as a switch that helps me visualize a grid when drawing. 
Enjoy :)
