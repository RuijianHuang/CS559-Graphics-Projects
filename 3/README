This program is an simple animation of a fighting scene between 2 monstrously 
simple stick figures. 

The hierarchy of drawing is demonstrated in different sections of the two stick 
figures' body.

All drawing is accomplished by using glmatrix library to build wrapper functions
for canvas' drawing functionalities (e.g. save(), restore, mult(), moveTo(), 
lineTo(), fillrect(), circle(), etc.). No canvas function related to these 
functionalities is invoked (with exceptions to ctx.moteTo() in moveTo, ctx.lineTo()
in lineTo(), and others such as ctx.beginPath() and ctx.fillStyle)

The slider below the drawing can be used to change the speed/intensity of the 
animation.

Have fun! (some computers' cooling system may be used more than usual during execution)
